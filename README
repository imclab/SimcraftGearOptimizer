Simcraft Gear Optimizer

This application attempts to find the best combination of items for a World of Warcraft character, that is, the 
set that will produce the highest DPS.  It performs a brute-force search of every possible combination of items by
running SimulationCraft ( http://code.google.com/p/simulationcraft/ ) on each set, and reporting the highest dps obtained 
and the gear set.

Caveat: I only use it on my warlock, so at this point the gemming logic is hardcoded for my needs.  It's not exactly 
fast, though that depends on how many items you are comparing, and the settings for the simulations.  On my Q9300 I get 
about 30 sets completed per second.

It's a C# 4 application built using VS 2010 beta 2, partly as an excuse to play with Parallel LINQ.  Simcraft is built into 
a C++/CLI assembly in order to evaluate each set.  I hacked up the Simcraft C++ in a few places to reduce the speed at which it 
leaks memory, as well as get access to some methods, etc.

To run, make a file named items.txt in the Data directory and put the item IDs of the items to search in there, one per line.  
You can use # at the start of a line to comment something out, and you can put the name of each item separated by a comma, 
e.g. "47617,Icehowl Cinch".  The name is only for your reference when editing the file, the name it prints out when running 
comes from the item XML info that is pulled down from Wowhead.

You also need to make a file called default.simc that contains the options for each run (except for the items which are 
filled in by the program separately for each gear set).
